# jv-akka-measuring-time

We can measure the messaging time between each actor.
However, the messaging time should still only be printed out by the last actor (n).
The output should be in the following format:

actor 1, message received <time‐in‐milli‐seconds> actor 2, message received <time‐in‐milli‐seconds>

...

actor n, message received <time‐in‐milli‐seconds>

Hint: You are allowed to adapt/extend the messages being sent among the actors to achieve this.
